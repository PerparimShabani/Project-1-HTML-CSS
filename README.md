## Future implementations/Ideas

For the future implementations/Ideas more time and knowledge is needed to add the features, pages and more to the website which was intended at first. 
 * One of the implements is to make it able to change languages on the website depending on the user. The studio is based in sweden but to be able to change the language in a city where alot of people with different languages reside and for visitors that might come would make it alot easier for everyone.
 * Touch up on the pricing page so you can sign up on any of the memebershipplans from the comfort of your own home.
 * Add a FAQ page so questions can be answered and a search feature to it so users can search if the question they have has been aseked and anwsered before.
 * Touch up more on the look of the page to make it more pleasent.
